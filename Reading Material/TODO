Framework / code ideas:

• Use a global object, save as much to global as possible, memory as backup for important things.
• Priority system to enable throttling of lower prio missions
init then init/update everything, then rolecall & action by priority, or even remove rolecall.
• Use Global.data like memory on heap

Psudo Framework:

----heap----
Init - 


----loop----
Init - with short circuit as should be in global, here incase fuckup?

Update -
