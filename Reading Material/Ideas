Improvements:
    *Use miners/haulers at rcl 2 with temp container instead of storage
    *Distance Transform for base planning auto setup
    *Scouting (room ranking for expansion, enemy loc, routing)
    *Auto Expand & unclaim (unclaim see snippets)
    *Remotes
    Rooms by effective level (incase of downgrade or attack, see snippets)
    Economy Tracking (room & remote e/tick, minerals)
    Assigning of energy ie if 100e left and closest creep has 100e then rest go do something else
    Mission level cpu tracking (Currently at operation level)
    Alternative Base Layout (Mini bunker / ext / lab stamps / Dynamic)
    Links
    Labs
    SK Rooms (Energy & Minerals)
    Advanced Tower/Defence Code (check for heal output, damage output, DEFCON status)
    DEFCON Status (stop remote missions, log enemy, )

Fixes:
    Refactor out Butlers, should be using haulers miners builders for RCL 2 +
    fix has respawned code and clearing flags/memory etc
    GC on construction sites (incase loss of room could have 10 sites forever there)
