ISSUES

Bunker placement is duplicate of base placement, includes health check (25t) so as to not let ramparts die. high mem/cpu spike usage.
Once rampart/wall built not added to repair que, builder will leave.
MoveTo only paths in current room, then exit to exit of other rooms. Use pathfinder (If walled, will room hop instead of pathing around to open side)

OVERVIEW TODO

Pioneer Mission
Builders to have dynamic Size to amount of hits to build (Currently 50w builder for 1 site)
Spawn repairers for repair roads (Foreman to build ramparts & walls)
calculate creep repair and only tower repair as backup? (Creeps are cheaper, maybe base can be managed by tower?(Repair	800 range ≤5 to 200 range ≥20))
//Refilling of towers (Butler?)
Manager sits at base (manages core buildings, terminal, link, nuke etc)
//Tower Code (Attack, Heal, Repair)
Safe Mode (if lose rampart)
Base setup / placement (Distance Transform & Min Cut or custom pathfinding that prefer walls and avoid base area in CM?)

Profiler setup (and finish stats)
Advanced Tower/Defence Code (check for heal output, damage output, DEFCON status)
DEFCON Status (stop remote missions, log enemy, )
Optimize global & Memory usage (Caching Cost Matrixs)
Optimize butlers & spawn to extension clumps.
Renew creeps when returning to base (Saves spawn time)
//Recycle creeps (Builders / Repairers etc)
//Excuse me nudging
Alternative Bunker (Mini bunker / ext / lab stamps)
link mining (build ext aswell?)
Locate / Pickup resources from ground/tombstones
Mineral Mining
Terminal Management (Buy minerals, Transfer Minerals/Energy to other rooms)

Remote mining
Scouting
Auto Expansion

Combat/Attack code (Evaluating attackers, Healers, Longbowmen, Drainers, Raiders, Maulers etc)

Lab Logic
Factorys

Highway room logic / Power harvesting
SK Room logic / Farming
Powercreep
