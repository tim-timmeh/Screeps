Framework / code ideas:

• Use a global object, save as much to global as possible, memory as backup for important things.
• split ops/miss into priority and execute in full to enable throttling of lower prio missions
init then init/update everything, then rolecall & action by priority, or even remove rolecall.

Psudo Framework:

----heap----
Init - check if king else create king on global


----loop----
Init - with short circuit as should be in global, here incase fuckup?
